# AITeacherAllocation
This repository create an AI to evaluate teacher allocation in peruvian public schools.

# Problem Definition

The numbers of classroom is determined in meets between by workers of ministry of education and workers of regional district schools.

In these meet the allocation of the classroom is based by the resolution [RMV 307-2019](https://cdn.www.gob.pe/uploads/document/file/436535/RVM_N__307-2019-MINEDU.pdf) but the resolution is discretionally to vary the allocation of classroom size in +-5 alums by classroom based on duly justified reasons.

This project is important for two reasons:
1. **Transparency**: Know the contribution of each factor and their relevance to determine the number of classroom give clear rules to incorporate in a new resolution.
2. **Improve the speed of the process**: All the process spend around 7 months in meetings, data processing, bureaucracy and budget allocation.
3. **Avoid budget constraint**: Allocate resource just in time.

This project aims to determine which factor determine the number of classroom in schools. We show:
- The contribution to each factor for the numbers of classroom.
- Which features are more important in determining the classroom.
- Predict the number of classroom in the schools to determine the teacher allocation.
